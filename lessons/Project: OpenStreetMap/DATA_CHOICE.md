# Origin of the data

The data comes from https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/dresden_germany/ as of 2017-08-29.

I have selected this dataset because Dresden is my hometown. I thought I might benefit from local knowledge if it comes to problems with the data. Also I know the people from the are very precise (if not pedantic) when it comes to contributing data on OSM, so I expected the dataset would be of very good quality.
