\begin_layout Title
Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\begin_layout Paragraph
1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The independent variable is the 
\emph on
condition
\emph default
, to which participants are exposed.
 This can be either the 
\emph on
congruent words condition 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 
\emph default
or the 
\emph on
incongruent words condition
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

.
 The dependent variable is the 
\emph on
time
\emph default
 it takes the participant 
\emph on
to name the ink color
\emph default
 for all the words in the corresponding set.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{C}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{I}$
\end_inset

 denote the time to solve the words of the respective condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{C}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{I}$
\end_inset

 denote the means of the solution times for the population of the respective
 condition 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{C}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{I}$
\end_inset

.
 The null hypothesis 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}$
\end_inset

 is that the average times to solve either problem set are equal, and the
 alternative hypothesis 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{A}$
\end_inset

 is that they are not.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
H_{0} & : & \mu_{C}=\mu_{I}\\
H_{A} & : & \mu_{C}\not=\mu_{I}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

-test is appropriate here, because the standard deviation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 of the population is unknown and the sample size is below 30 (http://www.statist
icshowto.com/when-to-use-a-t-score-vs-z-score/).
 We want to test if the sample means are different because the population
 means are different, or just by chance.
 It is a dependent 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

-test, because the same subject is tested in two different conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}_{C}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}_{I}$
\end_inset

 denote the sample means, i.e.
 the average time it took the subjects from the table to complete either
 condition.
 For the given dataset we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}_{C}=14.051$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{x}_{I}=22.016$
\end_inset

.
 The standard deviation for each condition are 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{C}=3.559$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{I}=4.797$
\end_inset

.
 Other measures of central tendency (e.g.
 median, mode) or variability (variance) are not needed for the test we
 are going to conduct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets have a look into the histogram.
 We start with the congruent words condition:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename histogram_congruent.png
	scale 50

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can see that it the participants between 7.5 and 22.5 seconds to read out
 loud the words of this condition.
 Most of the subjects spent between 10.0 and 12.5 seconds on the task (considering
 the resolution of this plot).
 From the shape of the graph it looks as if the 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{C}$
\end_inset

 are approximately normal distributed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next we compare with the histogram for the second condition:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename histogram_incongruent.png
	scale 50

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, the participants took between 12.0 and 36.0 seconds (again, this is
 imprecise because of the histogram bucket size).
 The mode lies somewhere between 20.0 and 24.0 seconds.
 Again, this looks approximately normal distributed, although it is not
 sure given the small number of ten samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly the two histograms are centered around the different averages of
 the samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
5
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conduct the 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

-test for paired samples, we define the pairwise difference of samples as
 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{i}=t_{I,i}-t_{C,i}$
\end_inset

.
 From the dataset we get the average difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{D}=7.965$
\end_inset

.
 There are 
\begin_inset Formula $n=24$
\end_inset

 samples and thus 23 degrees of freedom.
 We get our 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t=\frac{\bar{D}}{s/\sqrt{n}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is the sample standard deviation of the 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{i}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum(D_{i}-\bar{D})^{2}}{n-1}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our dataset we have 
\begin_inset Formula $s=4.865$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t=\frac{7.965}{4.865/\sqrt{24}}=8.02
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

-table (with 23 degrees of freedom) we get a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.0005$
\end_inset

.
 With a confidence level of 99.9% we can say that the sample means are not
 different by chance, but means of the two populations, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{C}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{I}$
\end_inset

 cannot not equal.
 Thus, we have to reject the null.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Personally, before doing the Stroop task I expected that the subjects (and
 I myself) will perform slower on the condition of incongruent words.
 However, I was surprised that the difference is so significant even with
 such a small number of participants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think the observed difference is caused by they way the human brain processes
 information.
 In the case of the Stroop effect each word comes with two interfering pieces
 of information: The meaning of the word and the ink color.
 The brain translates the input into a spoken word (the color of the ink).
 If the word's meaning and ink color are congruent, there is less 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

processing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 involved.
 However, if the two are incongruent, the brain takes more effort to process
 the information and focus on the relevant part (the ink color).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect) the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pieces of information
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are called stimuli.
 I guess that the brain can be trained to this task in a way that the stimulus
 of the word's meaning is ignored or forgotten, so to say.
 One could consider it the other way around: if the subject does not know
 the meaning of the word (e.g.
 a person that does not speak English), it will not be distracted by the
 conflicting stimulus.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A similar task I can think of would use digits and repetition numbers as
 stimuli: The subject would be presented with two sets of numbers consisting,
 where each number consists of one repeated digit from 1 until 9.
 The task is to name speak out loud the number of repetitions.
 In the congruent set, the number of repetitions and the actual digit coincide,
 for example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

22
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

55555
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, whereas in the second condition they are incongruent: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

444
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

77
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Like in the Stroop task, each subject would be presented a set of such
 numbers from each condition and the time to solve the task would be measured.
 I guess that in this experiment a similar interference of stimuli could
 be observed.
